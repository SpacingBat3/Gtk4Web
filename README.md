# Gtk4Web
Node.js library that integrates GTK theme with web-based software, using `node-gtk` module.

As of now, it's more a concept than anything being finished. As `node-gtk` is only used to gather the current theme name and CSS, it's more likely I will find a better for fetching that information from the current operating system that does not involves the use of Node.js native modules.
